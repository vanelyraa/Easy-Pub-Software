Pub Stock Management System 
Java Swing, IDE Netbeans, PHP/MariaDB
Java application designed for pubs. Created the system to manage sales (Point of sale), stock, suppliers, products, and users. Learned how to validate input both server and client-side, interact with a database in order to store and retrieve information, write PHP queries, create a login/logout system, including two different users (admin and staff).
